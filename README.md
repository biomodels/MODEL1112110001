**Abstract:**   
This paper develops a mathematical model for the feedback control of glucose
regulation in the healthy human being and is based on the work of Sorensen
(1985). The proposed model serves as a starting point for modeling type II
diabetes. Four agents - glucose and the three hormones insulin, glucagon, and
incretins - are assumed to have an effect on glucose metabolism. By letting
compartments represent anatomical organs, the model has a close resemblance to
a real human body. Mass balance equations that account for blood flows,
exchange between compartments, and metabolic sinks and sources are written,
and these result in simultaneous dif- ferential equations that are solved
numerically. The metabolic sinks and sources - removing or adding glucose,
insulin, glucagon, and incretins - describe physiological processes in the
body. These processes function as feedback control systems and have nonlinear
behaviors. The results of simulations performed for three different clinical
test types indicate that the model is successful in simulating intravenous
glucose, oral glucose, and meals containing mainly carbohydrates.
